## *Physical interpretation of the correction to Newtonâ€™s law by Schwarzschild metric*

This project was carried out during my first year of Master's studies.

It investigates how General Relativity corrects Newtonâ€™s law of gravitation through
the Schwarzschild metric.

After introducing the foundational concepts of General Relativity (equivalence
principle, geodesics, Einsteinâ€™s field equations), the report derives the
Schwarzschild solution and shows how it leads to a relativistic correction to
Newtonian gravity. This correction explains phenomena such as the
**perihelion precession of Mercury**, which classical mechanics cannot fully
account for.

The project includes an **analytical study** of the corrected equations and a
**numerical simulation** of Mercury's orbit using **Rungeâ€“Kutta methods**, 
in both **C**.
